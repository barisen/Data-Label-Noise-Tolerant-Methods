# Data Label Noise Tolerant Methods in Tabular Data

This work is the experimentation/coding part of the Research Paper attached to this repository.
Research mainly acts as a comprehensive analysis of Data Label Noise Tolerant methods in Tabular Data Sets.

First part of the notebook focuses on the creating a Topic Modelling for Literature Review.
Later part of the notebook compares different Label Noise Tolerant Methods such as Confident Learning, Active Learning etc. for different Tabular Datasets gathered from the internet.
